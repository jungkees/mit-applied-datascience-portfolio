# MIT Applied Data Science Program Portfolio

Welcome to my project repository for the MIT Applied Data Science Program. This repository hosts the notebooks for the main projects I completed as part of the program. Currently, I'm enhancing my data science competencies through the program, which I expect to complete by mid-August 2023:

1. [ExtraaLearn: Which Customers Should We Invest In?](https://github.com/jungkees/mit-applied-datascience-portfolio/blob/main/mit-adsp-extraalearn-project.ipynb)
2. [FoodHub: Understanding Customer Behavior and Restaurant Preferences](https://github.com/jungkees/mit-applied-datascience-portfolio/blob/main/mit-adsp-foodhub-project.ipynb)
3. Currently working on the capstone project. (To be updated)

## Project Overviews

### ExtraaLearn: Which Customers Should We Invest In?

This project aimed to develop a machine learning model to predict which customers are likely to convert into paying customers for an EdTech startup, ExtraaLearn. I conducted comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and fine-tuning. The project concluded with key insights and recommendations for ExtraaLearn.

### FoodHub: Understanding Customer Behavior and Restaurant Preferences

In this project, I conducted an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) of FoodHub's customer order data to understand customer behavior, preferences, and identify areas for improvement. The project provided actionable insights to FoodHub's business operations and strategies.
